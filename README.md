# Patient Studio, Backend Candidate Exercise 

This repo contains a brief assessment of Javascript and Typescript for backend engineering candidates applying to Patient Studio. The goal is to take a look at the `/src/index.ts` file that contains a number of functions in it. Each function has its own problem: some could have performance improvments, others need to be implemented.

DO NOT edit `/src/index.spec.ts` nor any of the files in `/src/data`. But feel free to add new types to `/src/types.d.ts`

The objective of this exercise is to refactor the functions in a way the you feel is appropriate and/or get broken function working so they pass the tests. You are free to use any external or 3rd party libraries you want.

Some principles to keep in mind that might be helpful:

* Performance
* Readability
* Scalability
* DRY principles
* Proper abstraction
* Functional/Declarative programming principles (optional but encouraged)
* Formatting and linting
* Leverage native language constructs
* Testability of code/functions
* Proper typing
* Comments as necessary
* Error checking and resilience

Please remember that the goal is not to find the perfect solution, but to reach a working solution and help us understand your programming and debugging style. We encourage commenting your code to expalin things in place, feel free to even include a notes file).


## Running
This template comes packaged with a `start` and `watch-and-run` NPM script.
`npm start` - TSC compile and run the index.ts file in non-watch mode.
`npm run watch-and-run` - TSC compile and run your index.js in watch mode which will recompile and restart the server on file changes.
`npm test` - Run TSC and execute all `*.specs.ts` files.

## Submitting Your Work
1. Create a new repository on GitHub and add the original fles
2. Add `morficus` as repository collaborators 
3. Createa new branch off `main` and call it `improvments`
4. Submit a PR from `improvments` to `main`
5. Assing `morficus` and `jefferson2z` as reviewers on the pull request
6. Create a [Loom video](https://www.loom.com/) where you walk through and explain your changes (feel free to do more than one video if needed)
7. Include a link to the Loom video in the PR description
